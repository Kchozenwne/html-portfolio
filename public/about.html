<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, I’m Duanalyn Katlego Wentzel, a passionate entrepreneur, web developer, and digital marketer dedicated to helping
  businesses grow through innovative online solutions. As the founder of Wentzel Media, I specialize in building high-performing
  websites and digital marketing strategies that empower small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to scale effectively.
  My journey into tech and business has been driven by a deep curiosity for problem-solving, an analytical mindset, and a passion
  for disruption. I'm currently studying Bachelor of Accounting at the University of Johannesburg, 
  aligning my education with my vision of building the biggest software and technology company in Africa.</p>

<p>Beyond business and technology, I strive to live a God-centered life, pursuing excellence in all I do while staying true to
  my values and fulfilling my purpose from my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. My entrepreneurial mindset is deeply shaped by my 
  resilience, passion, and commitment to impact-driven solutions. As an Allan Gray Orbis Foundation Candidate Fellow, I strive to 
  be a high-impact, responsible entrepreneur, and I am dedicated tousing my skills and resources to create meaningful change. My 
  interests also extend to trading, Formula 1, and football, where I’ve transitioned from aspiring to play professionally to 
  exploring how technology can revolutionize African football.</p>

<p>Through my work, I aim to achieve time, location, and financial freedom, allowing me to serve God’s people and empower businesses
  with cutting-edge digital solutions. Whether it's through crafting stunning websites, optimizing brands for success, or developing 
  future-focused tech innovations, my mission remains the same: to leave a lasting impact while honoring my faith. 
  If you’re looking for someone who is deeply invested in your brand’s success, let’s connect and build something great together</p>
